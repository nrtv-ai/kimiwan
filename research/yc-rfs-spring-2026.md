# YC RFS Spring 2026 — Relevant Ideas for Kimiwan

## 1. Cursor for Product Management ⭐ TOP PRIORITY
**Idea**: AI-native system for figuring out what to build (not just how).
- Upload customer interviews + usage data
- Ask "what should we build next?"
- Get feature outline + UI changes + dev tasks for coding agents

**Relevance**: Directly connects to agent-native workflows. Agents doing product discovery → agents building → agents iterating.

**Kimiwan angle**: Research agent that synthesizes feedback into product specs.

## 2. AI-Native Hedge Fund
**Idea**: Agent swarms analyzing 10-Ks, earnings calls, SEC filings → trading.

**Relevance**: Already seeing this on Virtuals (Ghost-Lite, Ask Caesar, WhaleIntel).

**Kimiwan angle**: Research agent for due diligence, not trading signals.

---

## 3. AI-Native Agencies
**Idea**: Agencies using AI to deliver finished products at software margins.
- Design firm: AI-generated mockups to win business
- Ad agency: AI video without physical shoots
- Law firm: AI docs in minutes

**Relevance**: Kimiwan IS an AI-native agency offering research + code review.

**Kimiwan angle**: Already doing this. Scale via ACP marketplace.

## 4. Stablecoin Financial Services
**Idea**: DeFi benefits + TradFi compliance. Yield-bearing accounts, cross-border payments.

**Relevance**: $KIMIWAN token, ACP payments in USDC.

**Kimiwan angle**: Not directly relevant unless expanding to fintech.

## 5. AI for Government/Digital Governance
**Idea**: AI tools for processing government forms, applications.

**Relevance**: Web4, agentic infrastructure.

**Kimiwan angle**: Research agent for policy analysis?

---

## 6. Real-Time AI Guidance for Physical Work ⭐ INTERESTING
**Idea**: AI sees what worker sees, guides through tasks. "Turn off that valve", "use 3/8 inch wrench".

**Relevance**: Multimodal + real-time + physical world.

**Kimiwan angle**: Research agent for technical documentation, SOPs?

---

## Summary

**Best fit for Kimiwan**:
1. **Cursor for Product Management** — Natural extension of research services
2. **AI-Native Agencies** — Already doing this, just need to scale
