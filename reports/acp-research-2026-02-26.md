## 3. Pricing Recommendations (50%+ Profit Margin)

### 3.1 Cost Base Analysis

Using Claude Sonnet 4.6 as our primary model (best balance):
- Input: $3.00 per 1M tokens
- Output: $15.00 per 1M tokens

**Average blended cost assumption:** ~$9.00 per 1M tokens (assuming 50/50 input/output mix)

### 3.2 Minimum Pricing for 50% Margin

To maintain >50% profit margin: **Price > Token Cost × 1.5**

| Service Type | Token Cost | Minimum Price (1.5x) | Recommended Price (2x) |
|--------------|------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Simple task (~1K tokens) | $0.009 | $0.0135 | $0.018 |
| Medium task (~10K tokens) | $0.09 | $0.135 | $0.18 |
| Complex task (~100K tokens) | $0.90 | $1.35 | $1.80 |

### 3.3 Recommended Pricing Strategy

**Hybrid Model:**
1. **Per-Action Pricing** for customer clarity
   - Simple tasks: $0.50-$1.00 per action
   - Medium tasks: $2.00-$5.00 per action
   - Complex tasks: $10.00+ per action

2. **Credit-Based System** for flexibility
   - 1,000 credits: $20 (entry)
   - 10,000 credits: $150 (20% discount)
   - 100,000 credits: $1,000 (50% discount)
   - Simple task = 10 credits, Medium = 50 credits, Complex = 200 credits

3. **Subscription Tiers** for recurring revenue
   - Starter: $49/month (includes 100 actions)
   - Professional: $199/month (includes 500 actions)
   - Enterprise: Custom pricing

## 4. New Service Opportunities

### 4.1 Opportunity 1: **AI Code Review & Refactoring Agent**

**Market Gap:** Developers need automated code review that goes beyond linting—semantic understanding, security analysis, and refactoring suggestions.

**Competitive Landscape:**
- GitHub Copilot: $10-19/user/month (limited review features)
- CodeRabbit: $15/user/month
- No dedicated "deep review" agent in market

**Our Offering:**
- Deep code analysis using Claude Sonnet's reasoning
- Security vulnerability detection
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Refactoring recommendations with diffs

**Pricing:** $0.50 per file reviewed or $99/month unlimited for small teams

### 4.2 Opportunity 2: **Multi-Platform Content Adaptation Agent**

**Market Gap:** Content creators need to adapt one piece of content across multiple platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, Blog) with platform-native formatting and tone.

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Buffer: $6-$120/month (scheduling only)
- Hootsuite: $99-$739/month (management, not creation)
- No AI-native content adaptation service

**Our Offering:**
- Input: One long-form article or video transcript
- Output: Platform-optimized versions for LinkedIn, Twitter/X threads, Instagram captions, email newsletter
- Includes hashtag suggestions and optimal posting time recommendations

**Pricing:** $2 per content piece adapted or $49/month for 50 adaptations
