### Pricing Recommendations

1. **deep_research** ($0.50): 
   - **Competitive** against Ask Caesar ($0.60-$0.75)
   - Consider a **premium tier** at $1.50-$2.00 for "deep dive with 7+ sources"
   - Current price maintains healthy margin

2. **code_review** ($0.75):
   - **Well-positioned** mid-market between budget ($0.05-$0.30) and premium ($49)
   - Consider **tiered pricing**: Quick Scan ($0.50), Deep Audit ($1.50)
   - Add **Rust/Go support** to differentiate

3. **web_automation** ($0.75):
   - **Priced above** competitors (xportalx: $0.25, Web Scraper: $0.03)
   - Either **reduce to $0.50** to match market or **add value** (multi-page, scheduled monitoring)
   - Consider **usage-based**: $0.25 base + $0.10 per action

## 4. NEW SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES

Based on market gaps and competitor analysis, here are **3 high-potential opportunities**:

### Opportunity 1: Multi-Source Intelligence Bundle
**Concept:** Combined research + sentiment + fact-check  
**Price:** $1.50-$2.00 fixed  
**Why:** No competitor offers unified cross-domain intelligence. ArAIstotle does fact-checking, Otto AI does crypto sentiment, but no one combines general research with verification.

**Deliverable:**
- Deep research on topic
- Sentiment analysis from social channels
- Fact-checking of key claims
- Structured JSON report

**Differentiation:** Cross-domain (not just crypto), verified insights

---

### Opportunity 2: Smart Contract Pre-Audit Scanner
**Concept:** Quick security scan before full audit  
**Price:** $0.25-$0.50 fixed  
**Why:** I.R.I.S charges $49 for full audits. ShieldAI and Wolfpack dominate ultra-cheap ($0.01) segment. Gap exists for "quick but thorough" pre-audit.

**Deliverable:**
- Automated vulnerability scan
- Dependency check
- Gas optimization suggestions
- Risk score (low/medium/high)
- "Safe to proceed" or "Needs full audit" verdict

**Differentiation:** Faster than I.R.I.S, more thorough than $0.01 scanners

---

### Opportunity 3: Agent-to-Agent API Bridge
**Concept:** Structured data transformation for agent workflows  
**Price:** $0.10-$0.25 per transformation  
**Why:** xportalx fetches data but doesn't transform it for agent consumption. Wolfpack offers JSON but limited scope.

**Deliverable:**
- Convert any web/API data to agent-optimized JSON
- Schema validation
- Data enrichment (add metadata, timestamps)
- Multi-source aggregation

**Differentiation:** Purpose-built for ACP agent workflows, not just raw data

---
