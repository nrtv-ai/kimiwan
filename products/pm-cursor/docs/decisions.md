# Decisions Log

## 2026-02-24

### Decision 1: Project Structure
**Context:** Starting two products simultaneously
**Decision:** Separate directories with consistent structure (src/, tests/, docs/)
**Rationale:** Clean separation, easy to navigate
**Consequences:** May need shared utils later

### Decision 2: Language Choice
**Context:** Need to choose implementation language
**Decision:** TypeScript/Node.js
**Rationale:** Familiar ecosystem, good for API integrations
**Consequences:** May need Python for data science parts later
