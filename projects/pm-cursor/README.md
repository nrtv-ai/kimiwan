# PM-Cursor

**AI-Native Project Management Tool**

PM-Cursor is an intelligent project management platform designed for the AI era. Unlike traditional PM tools that treat AI as an afterthought, PM-Cursor is built from the ground up with AI agents as first-class citizens in the project workflow.

## Vision

We believe the future of project management is not about humans managing AI, but about **humans and AI collaborating seamlessly** to deliver better outcomes faster.

### Core Principles

1. **AI-Native Architecture** - Every feature is designed with AI collaboration in mind
2. **Context-Aware Intelligence** - AI agents understand project context, history, and goals
3. **Transparent Decision Making** - Clear visibility into AI recommendations and actions
4. **Human-in-the-Loop** - Humans retain control while AI handles the heavy lifting
5. **Continuous Learning** - The system improves from every interaction
