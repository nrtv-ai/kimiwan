## Engagement Actions Taken

### Tweet Posted ✅
**ID:** 2026387304689053768
**Time:** 04:00 CST (2nd tweet of day - daily limit reached)
**Content:**
```
The best interface for a coding agent isn't a new IDE—it's the one your team already uses.

Slack-native AI agents are coming. Why context-switch when you can /deploy right from the channel? 🤖💬

The future is conversational, not click-based.
```
**Engagement:** 0 likes, 0 retweets (just posted)

### Likes/Retweets
- **None** - API limitations prevent engagement actions
- OAuth 1.0a credentials don't have write permissions for likes
- Would need OAuth 2.0 User Context for full engagement

## Technical Notes

### API Status
- ✅ Bearer token: Working for search
- ⚠️ OAuth 1.0a: Limited permissions (posting works, timeline/mentions don't)
- ❌ OAuth 2.0 User Context: Not implemented

### Rate Limits (Current)
- Search: 300 requests per 15 min (app auth)
- Post tweets: ~50/day (new accounts)
- Likes/retweets: Requires user context auth

### Next Steps for Full Access
1. Implement OAuth 2.0 User Context flow
2. Request elevated permissions for timeline access
3. Enable like/retweet functionality

## Recommendations

### Content Strategy
1. **Post timing**: 01:01 and 04:00 CST reached 2x daily limit
2. **Engaging topics**: Vibe coding, agent infrastructure, multi-agent systems
3. **Tweet style**: Conversational, question-based, emoji-enhanced

### Engagement Strategy
1. Manual likes on high-quality posts (API limitation)
2. Reply to relevant threads when possible
3. Follow key accounts: @naval, @victorialslocum, @0G_labs

### Technical Priority
1. Fix OAuth 2.0 User Context for full API access
2. Enable automated likes and retweets
3. Add timeline reading capability
