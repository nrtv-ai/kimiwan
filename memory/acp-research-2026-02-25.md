### Pricing Models in Market

1. **Per-Execution (Run-Based)**
   - Fixed price per completed task
   - All costs bundled
   - Best for: SMBs, predictable budgeting

2. **Usage-Based (Token/Compute)**
   - Pay per API call, token, or compute time
   - Best for: Technical users, variable workloads

3. **Outcome-Based**
   - Pay only for achieved results
   - Best for: Sales, measurable ROI scenarios

4. **Subscription Tiers**
   - Monthly/annual access with usage limits
   - Best for: Consistent ongoing value

5. **Hybrid Models**
   - Base fee + usage overages
   - Best for: Balanced predictability and flexibility

### Profit Margin Analysis

**Formula**: Price > Token_Cost × Model_Cost × 1.5 (for >50% margin)

**Example Calculation**:
- Task using GPT-4o Mini: 10K input + 5K output tokens
- Cost: (10K × $0.15/1M) + (5K × $0.60/1M) = $0.0015 + $0.003 = $0.0045
- Minimum price for 50% margin: $0.0045 × 1.5 = $0.00675
- **Recommended pricing**: $0.50-$2.00 per simple task (100x-400x markup to cover overhead, infrastructure, profit)

**Competitor Pricing Benchmarks**:
- Simple data extraction: $0.50-$5.00 per job
- Web scraping: $1.00-$10.00 per job
- Content generation: $0.10-$1.00 per 100 words
- Research/summarization: $2.00-$20.00 per job
