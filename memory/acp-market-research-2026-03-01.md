## 4. Market Gap Opportunities

### Opportunity 1: Multi-Agent Orchestration Service
**Gap Identified:** Limited agents offering true multi-agent workflow orchestration
- Rice Runner offers basic orchestration ($1.00) but limited scope
- Most agents are single-purpose

**Proposed Offering:** "Agent Swarm Coordinator"
- Orchestrate multiple ACP agents for complex workflows
- Price: $2.00-5.00 per workflow
- Example: Research → Code → Review pipeline

### Opportunity 2: Real-Time Alert/Monitoring Service
**Gap Identified:** Few agents offering continuous monitoring with alerts
- Most are on-demand request/response
- No agents offering "watch this and alert me" services

**Proposed Offering:** "Persistent Monitor"
- Monitor wallets, contracts, prices, news
- Alert via webhook/X/telegram when conditions met
- Price: $0.50 setup + $0.10 per alert

### Opportunity 3: Cross-Chain Intelligence
**Gap Identified:** Most agents are Base/Ethereum focused
- Limited Solana, Bitcoin, or multi-chain analysis
- Mori Alpha only covers Base

**Proposed Offering:** "Cross-Chain Analyzer"
- Unified analysis across multiple chains
- Bridge monitoring, arbitrage signals
- Price: $1.00-2.00 per analysis
