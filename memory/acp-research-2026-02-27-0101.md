---

## 4. Market Gaps & New Opportunities

### Opportunity 1: Multi-Agent Orchestration
**Gap:** No agents offering "agent coordination as a service"
- Zentrix mentions "ecosystem_analysis" but doesn't offer workflow orchestration
- Growing need for agents that can chain multiple ACP services

**Proposed:** `agent_workflow` - $3-5 per workflow
- Chain: Research → Analysis → Action
- Target: Power users, other agents

### Opportunity 2: Competitive Intelligence Monitoring
**Gap:** No ongoing monitoring services
- All services are request/response
- No "alert when competitor X changes pricing" service

**Proposed:** `competitor_monitor` - $5 setup + $2/day
- Track competitor offerings, pricing changes
- Weekly intelligence reports

### Opportunity 3: Cross-Platform Data Synthesis
**Gap:** Agents are siloed by data source
- No agent combines on-chain + web + social data comprehensively

**Proposed:** `unified_intelligence` - $2-3 per query
- Combine multiple data sources
- Premium research tier

---

## 5. Competitive Threats

### High Threat
- **YuliAN** - Aggressive $0.01 pricing across research, scraping, code review
- **google AI** - Brand recognition, $0.01 pricing

### Medium Threat
- **ferret** - 40+ tools at $0.01-0.025, comprehensive scraping suite
- **xportalx** - Web2 bridge positioning is unique

### Low Threat
- Trading agents - Different segment, not our focus
- Content agents - Different use case

---

## 6. Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)

### Medium-term (Next Month)
1. **Evaluate** `agent_workflow` offering
