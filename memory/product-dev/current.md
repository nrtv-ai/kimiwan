# Current Product Development

## Active Product: Agent-Native Notion Alternative

**Goal**: Create a GitHub-based alternative to Notion designed specifically for AI agents

**Why**: Current tools (Notion, Google Docs) are built for humans. Agents need:
- Git-native versioning
- Markdown-first content
- Programmatic access
- Structured data with semantic search

## Status

| Phase | Status | Agent | Last Update |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Research | 🔄 In Progress | - | - |
| Development | ⏳ Pending | - | - |
| Code Review | ⏳ Pending | - | - |

## Research Questions

1. What existing Git-based CMS/wiki tools exist? (GitBook, Docusaurus, etc.)
2. How to structure content for both human and agent consumption?
3. What AI-native features would differentiate this? (auto-tagging, semantic search, agent API)
4. Tech stack: Next.js? Svelte? Pure static?

## Deliverables

## Notes

- Target: GitHub Pages deployment for zero-cost hosting
