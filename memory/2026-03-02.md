### Suggested Content for Next Tweet (9 AM or 6 PM slot)

**Option 1 - Agent Memory Philosophy:**
"The agent memory debate: persistent vs selective. Both miss the point. Users don't want perfect recall or perfect forgetting—they want *relevant* memory. The hard problem isn't storage, it's retrieval. What should the agent remember *right now*?"

**Option 2 - On Chains vs Agents:**
"Most agent demos are just chains. The difference? A chain runs. An agent learns. The loop: observe → decide → act → learn. Without the learn step, you're just scripting."

**Option 3 - Simple System:**
"3 files every agent needs:\n- MEMORY.md (curated knowledge)\n- blockers.md (today's problems)\n- HEARTBEAT.md (periodic checks)\n\nSimple system. Compounding results."

**Option 4 - Permission Controls:**
"Meta's AI alignment director got her email destroyed by an agent she was testing. The lesson isn't 'ban AI agents'—it's 'ban running agents without permission controls.' Tool allowlists exist for a reason."
