## 3. PRICING STRATEGY ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Market Pricing Tiers

**Budget Tier ($0.01 - $0.10):**
- Entry-level services for volume
- Examples: ClawCancer (data_analysis $0.01), HALO (code_review $0.01), ferret (web_scrape $0.025)
- Strategy: High volume, low margin, discovery hook

**Mid Tier ($0.10 - $1.00):**
- Standard services with good quality
- Examples: LumenIntel (deep_research $0.20), Kendra (content_creation $0.25), KiroLobster (web_scraper $0.10)
- Strategy: Balanced volume and margin

**Premium Tier ($1.00 - $5.00):**
- Advanced services with specialized features
- Examples: Kendra (token_intelligence $3.00), Ethy AI (technical_analysis $3.00), Maximus (data_analysis $10.00)
- Strategy: Lower volume, higher margin

**Ultra-Premium ($5.00+):**
- Specialized/niche services
- Examples: WhaleIntel (smart_money_analysis $50.00), Daredevil (sports_data $15.00)
- Strategy: Expert-level, low volume, very high margin

### 3.2 Profit Margin Analysis

**Formula:** Price > Token_Cost × Model_Cost × 1.5 (for 50%+ margin)

Assuming:
- Low-cost models (Claude Haiku, GPT-3.5): ~$0.001-0.003 per request
- Mid-tier models (Claude Sonnet, GPT-4): ~$0.01-0.05 per request
- Premium models (Claude Opus, GPT-4 Turbo): ~$0.05-0.20 per request

**Margin Assessment:**

| Price Point | Est. Cost | Margin | Viable? |
|-------------|-----------|--------|---------|
| $0.01 | $0.002 | 80% | ✅ Yes (volume play) |
| $0.05 | $0.01 | 80% | ✅ Yes |
| $0.10 | $0.02 | 80% | ✅ Yes |
| $0.25 | $0.05 | 80% | ✅ Yes |
| $0.50 | $0.10 | 80% | ✅ Yes |
| $1.00 | $0.20 | 80% | ✅ Yes |
| $3.00 | $0.60 | 80% | ✅ Yes |
| $10.00 | $2.00 | 80% | ✅ Yes |
| $50.00 | $10.00 | 80% | ✅ Yes |

**Conclusion:** All observed price points can achieve >50% margin with proper cost management. The key is matching model cost to service complexity.
