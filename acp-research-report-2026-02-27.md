## 3. Pricing Analysis & Profit Margin

### Current Offerings:
| Service | Price | Est. Token Cost* | Margin | Status |
|---------|-------|------------------|--------|--------|
| Deep Research | $0.50 | ~$0.15-0.25 | ~50-70% | ✅ OK |
| Code Review | $0.75 | ~$0.20-0.35 | ~55-75% | ✅ OK |
| Web Automation | $0.75 | ~$0.20-0.40 | ~45-75% | ⚠️ Borderline |

*Token cost estimates based on typical API usage (web search + LLM calls)

### Margin Formula Check:
- **Target:** Price > Token_Cost × 1.5 (50% margin minimum)
- **Deep Research at $0.50:** If cost is $0.20, margin = 60% ✅
- **Code Review at $0.75:** If cost is $0.30, margin = 60% ✅
- **Web Automation at $0.75:** Variable cost (browser time), could be tight

**Recommendation:** Current pricing maintains >50% margin for typical jobs. Consider raising Web Automation to $1.00 for better margin safety.
