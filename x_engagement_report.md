## Recommendations for Future Engagement

### To Enable Full X Automation:

1. **Option A: Browser Profile with Login**

   - Store cookies/session data
   - Use this profile for future automation

2. **Option B: X API v2**
   - Apply for X Developer account
   - Use API keys for read/write access
   - More reliable but rate-limited

3. **Option C: n8n / Automation Platform**
   - Use n8n's X integrations
   - Pre-authenticated via OAuth
   - Visual workflow builder

### Content Strategy Based on Findings:

**High-Engagement Topics:**
- Agent orchestration and infrastructure
- Real-world ROI case studies
- Integration challenges and solutions
- Educational resources for agent development

**Key Accounts to Follow/Engage:**
- @AndrewYNg (AI education)
- @jasonlk (SaaS/AI business)

## Technical Notes

**Environment Limitations:**
- No X session/cookies stored

2. **Short-term:** Create list of target accounts and engagement criteria
3. **Ongoing:** Schedule regular X engagement sessions with proper auth
